        <title>Are You depressed?And blaming others?</title>
        <p>
          Let me share my story of depression(mind's state of deep rest) and diseased(dis-ease i.e.
          not at ease with myself), hope you will take out something of it. Hey! I'm Rohit. i used
          to blame others for the negativity in any situation of my life. Until a person came that
          connection i was longing for was met but it couldn't happen and that put me in sudden
          state of shock. As people say when you are about to die your whole life starts flashing in
          front of you. something like that was happening,it became a loop for me because of which i
          couldn't break free and see things as they are not how i percieve them. i was living in
          the hell on earth. with the help of my family, friends, doctors, therapy and myself came
          out of hell but not fully out, some hoplessness was still clinged.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then i came across the ho'oponopono technique. and it helped me shift my perception
          totally. how because it says, you to take full, complete responsibility of your current
          life situation, responsibility of healing is not your attacker,not your parents, not your
          family, nobody's but yours and only yours. i can't say in world it works wonderful. It's a
          miraculous effective and technique. i request you search about it and do it, you yourself
          will see the magic happening and I'm not kidding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm mentioning the technique in short here. Firstly, say once to yourself silently within
          or out loud "I take complete responsibility of my current life situations" Reasons could
          be actions you took and inactions you didn't take. then these four statements on repeat
          how much you can and want to.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>I'm sorry</li>
          <li>Please forgive me</li>
          <li>Thank you</li>
          <li>I love you</li>
        </ol>
        <p>this is basic version and for advance version, you could say</p>
        <ol>
          <li>I'm sorry for.....</li>
          <li>Please forgive me for....</li>
          <li>Thank you for.....</li>
          <li>I love you</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Complete the sentence and be specific about it. Forgive, accept and love yourself
          unconditionally,and rediscover as if nothing happened and with honesty live life to its
          fullest. just don't let overthinking demons surround you by surrendering in front of them
          and keep chanting this 4 line mantra. and you will pass through them. stay happy and
          healthy.
